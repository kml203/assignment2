        <h1>Who is Hatsune Miku?</h1>
        <p>Hatsune Miku is a wildly popular and globally beloved character mascot associated with a software voicebank developed by Crypton Future Media inc. in 2007. She has had her own concerts, games, merchandise, and has even appeared at Coachella.</p>

            <h2>Development and Use</h2>
            <p>Hatsune Miku is referred to as the first Vocaloid, and she is one of the many voice banks released for the singing voice synthesizer software. Her singing is sampled from voice actress Saki Fujita, whose voice is separated into controlled syllables to be formed into the desired sentences or sounds.</p>

            <h2>Rise to Stardom</h2>
            <p>So, why exactly is Hatsune Miku so popular? There are a few reasons for this, but two stick above the rest: <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>content</strong>. Anyone can use her, much like one would an instrument, and anyone who wants to make music is able to do so with a familiar voice that has a dedicated fanbase.</p>
            <p>Because so many people were making music with Hatsune Miku at the forefront, her popularity snowballed much faster than if it was just one person producing songs. These 'Producers', sometimes shortened to just 'P's, have created songs totaling hundreds of millions of views across different platforms. See section 3 for some of the all-time most popular ones!</p>

        <p>Hatsune Miku is a clever name translating to "the first sound of the future", modeled after her concept of an android in a future where songs have been lost. Seeing her impact today, it's no exaggeration to say she has lived up to her name. Her songs and adoring fanbase have enabled Miku to have her own games, concerts, figurines, clothes, and more, which speaks to the cultural phenomenon she is today.</p>
